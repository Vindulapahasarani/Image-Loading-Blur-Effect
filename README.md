# Image Loading Blur Effect

This repository contains a simple HTML, CSS, and JavaScript project that demonstrates an image loading blur effect. The effect gradually reveals an image while it's loading, providing visual feedback to the user.

## Features

- **Dynamic Loading**: The image loading blur effect dynamically adjusts based on the loading progress.
- **Blur Effect**: Utilizes CSS and JavaScript to create a blur effect that gradually fades as the image loads.
- **Percentage Display**: Shows the loading progress in percentage to keep users informed.

## How it Works

1. **HTML Structure**: The `index.html` file contains the basic HTML structure with an image element and a placeholder for displaying loading progress.
2. **CSS Styling**: The `style.css` file provides necessary styling to center elements and maintain visual coherence.
3. **JavaScript Logic**: The `script.js` file contains JavaScript logic to incrementally reveal the image while it loads and apply the blur effect.
4. **Progress Update**: Loading progress is displayed in percentage, giving users a clear indication of the loading status.

## Usage

To use this image loading blur effect in your project:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Replace the sample image (`1.jpg`) with your desired image.
3. Customize the loading animation and styling in `style.css` to match your project's design.
4. Modify the JavaScript logic in `script.js` if needed, such as adjusting the loading duration or maximum count.
5. Embed the HTML structure and necessary scripts into your project.
